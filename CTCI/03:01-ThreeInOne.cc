/*
Describe how to use a single array to implement 3 stacks
*/

/*

1. Fixed Size

- Split the array into 3 parts and use those as stacks, increasing size of array when one stack fills up its respective part

2. Dynamic
- Set a starting point in each array for the stack and allow it to grow/change depending on which stack needs more space
